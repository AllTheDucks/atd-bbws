Blackboard Gradebook REST Web Service B2
===================

This building block provides easy access to the Blackboard Gradebook via a REST
  Web Service.

**Currently under development. YMMV**

Building
----------
To build this project, clone the project to a local directory ````cd```` to the directory, then run the following command for unix/osx.
````
./gradlew build
````
or, for windows.
````
gradlew.bat build
````

You can find the building block war file in the ````build/libs```` directory.


Web Service Usage
-----------

All request paths must begin with

`https://yourbbinstall.edu/webapps/atd-bbws-BBLEARN/ws/`

`BBLEARN` may be replaced with `bb_bb60` if your Bb installation has
been upgraded from an old (pre 9.1) version.


Authentication
--------------
All requests require credentials passed using HTTP Basic Auth. In curl this would look
like the following.
````
curl -u username:password https://yourbbinstall.edu/blah/blah/blah
````

**Basic Auth credentials are *NOT* encrypted. Make sure all your requests are
performed over https**

Before you start using the WebService, you must configure a username and password
on the Building Block settings page.
